I'm a Software Engineer with a robust technical stack spanning multiple programming languages and cloud technologies.

My expertise spans Typescript, Node.js, React.js, React Native, Expo, Astro, and SSR with Next.js for web and mobile application development.

On the back-end, I work with AWS services, Apache Airflow, Data pipelines, languages such as Typescript, Python, and Golang with experience in REST and GraphQl APIs.

Database technologies in my toolkit include MongoDB, DynamoDB, PostgreSQl, and Microsoft SQL Server.

Also, I'm an Neovim enthusiast with a custom configuration, reflecting my commitment to optimizing my development workflow.
